# Garmin IMG JavaScript

[**LIVE**](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/garmin-img)

`npx serve .` then `localhost:5000`

The shortcut icon is from the FatCow icon set.

This project is probably abandoned because the Garmin files do not contain a great amount of vector detail so the final render
wouldn't look that nice and they are kinda cryptic so it's a lot of effort compated to other stuff like MBTILES.
